## Credits
- We want to thank Anthony and Max for all of their help!

## Challenges
As a group we had many challenges with React. Populating images and maintaining our folder structure was a struggle. We had to redesign our wireframe a few times as well. Overall, we found ourselves teaching each other and doubling down on research to get functionality.

## Successes
 Although at times we felt extremely frustrated, we kept pushing to better develop our concept, while learning along the way. 

 ## Future Development
 
- Process payment.
- reVamped can sell other items besides Apparel.
- An Elite subscription membership that gives guests cheaper prices and better deals.
- Free delivery for Elite subscription members. 
- Guests can save searched items to a wishlist.
- Guests can see Item suggestions based on previous purchases or searched items.
